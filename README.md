Bots and stuff
----------------
***WARNING***: I have absolutely no idea how to use github properly, this is my first project on this site. I'm assuming I should put the intructions here or something. 

## What it does:

It's a reddit bot. It scans through comments of subreddits for the words "me too thanks" and replies with a random 3 word phrase that rhymes with "me too thanks", for example, "Bee shoo planks" (It usually doesn't make much sense).

## Getting Started:

Download and Install praw (the package that connects to the reddit api) at:
http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html 

Then just download everything and run either of the 2 run files (ShittySkynetRun2.py just prints out more details about the process)

The reddit account I used for testing and stuff is included in the files, the user id and password can be found in the BeepBoop.py, its also where you should change the id and password to your own if you want to run the bot off your own account.

To run it off your own reddit account:
  - Log in
  - Click on the preferences link
  - Click on the apps tab
  - Click on the create an appâ€¦ 
  - Give a unique name and ~meaningful~ adequate description to the application, and select script. 
  - Any URL can be used for for about url and redirect uri. I used example.com
  - Click on create app
  - There should be a client id and client secret
  - Replace the client id and client secret in the BeepBoop.py file

In case you do decide to use my account:
Try to not do anything illegal or unethical, also I may or may not have gotten banned off of /r/meirl, /r/me_irl, /r/gaming and /r/Askreddit (they don't want bots on their subreddits).

Best of luck,
